## Description

Welcome to the "MyReads App - Project" by Udacity.
Goal is it, to create a bookshelf app, which allows you to store books from a database in three different shelf categories: 
- Currently Reading
- Want to Read
- Read

There also is a search function, which allows to search in that database, and add a book to your shelf.

## Starter Code

There was a starter code provided by Udacity, but it was hardcoded and not seperated into components. Also the booksshelfs were not updated when moving the book into another shelf.

## Learning goals

So reagarding to the starter code the learning goals for this project were to create an app with React and use "useState" to keep track of the state of the books. What specification the app needs to fullfill to pass, you find under "https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/4971/view".

## How to start the app

If you want to start the app on your local machine make sure you installed npm by typing 'npm -v' to the console. 
If it' installed, you can run 'npm install' to install the neccessary node-modules, and then 'npm start' to get the application to your browser.

If you haven't installed npm, visit "https://nodejs.org" and install it.
